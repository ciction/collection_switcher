# collection_switcher
## Isolate Blender collections within a given parent collection

This is handy for comparing multiple 3D sene setups in your scene with one another.
especially when dealing with many collections.


After installing this addon a new panel will appear in the view 3D "N-panel", under "tools"
There you'll find the "isolate Collection" panel.

1) select a parent collection
2) A list of buttons will appear, one for each of the child collections inside the parent collection
